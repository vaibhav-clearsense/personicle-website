  - title: "Bring your data in one place"
    content: "Personal data collected by various devices is typically managed and utilized only by that application. Therefore, these applications have only a narrow view of user lifestyle and health. We aim to bring all such data in one place and get a clearer picture of users' health outcomes."

  - title: "Complete control over data"
    content: "Our core belief is that users should have complete control over their data and how it is being utilized. We are building robust privacy and security protocols to ensure that any application (including personicle) can only access the data that the users have authorized."
    
  - title: "Securely share your data with physicians"
    content: "Typically in a clinical setting, physicians and care providers  have very limited (and inaccurate) information about patient lifestyle and symptom progression. Personicle aims to alleviate this problem by allowing users to securely share their data with physicians registered on the personicle platform."
